# Whack A Mole

A simple Whack-A-Mole web game with a Mongoose-based C server.

## Run locally (Windows)

Build:

```powershell
cd "C:\Users\Ankitha.A\OneDrive\Desktop\Whack_a_Mole\Whack_a_Mole"
gcc -std=c11 -O2 server.c mongoose.c -o server.exe -lws2_32 -Wall -Wextra
```

Run:

```powershell
.\server.exe
# Open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

## Notes
- The `web/` directory contains the frontend (HTML/CSS/JS).
- If the server fails to bind the port, ensure nothing else is using port 8000 and that you have permission to bind to it.
- For quick testing without compiling, use the `server_py.py` script (Python 3 required) which implements the same endpoints.
